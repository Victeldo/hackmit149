Sustainability Track

For HackMIT 2022, our group wanted to participate in the Sustainability Track as we wanted to find solutions for global problems. We all agreed on trying to fix the global
food wastage problem. Hence, we decided to make a platform where food banks, soup kitchens, and other organizes that request large bundles of food can get the food left
by restaurants, stores, supermarkets, and local grocers. In our application, we have the client submit some information about what they are looking for in their suppliers.
Later, the app would make call to the Google Maps and GeoLib API to get the geometric distance from the origin point to the location of the suppliers. Afterwards, the code 
will go through an algorithm designed to produce a percentage associated with the compatibililty of the client and the supplier (both individual and combination of suppliers), and 
eventually renders a new page where it displays all of the possible options.
